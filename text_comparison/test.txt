Any measures the Republic of Korea takes regarding Takeshima based on such an illegal occupation have no legal justification.","","Japan will continue to seek the settlement of the dispute over territorial sovereignty over Takeshima on the basis of international law in a calm and peaceful manner.","","Note: The Republic of Korea has never demonstrated any clear basis for its claims that it had taken effective control over Takeshima prior to Japan's effective control over Takeshima and reaffirmation of its territorial sovereignty in 1905.","","","","","","","","Location Map","","Surrounding Area","","","","","","","Detailed Map","","","","","","","","","Video:Takeshima - Seeking a Solution based on Law and Dialogue","","","Leaflet: Takeshima(PDF)","","Pamphlet: Takeshima　(10 pages) (PDF)","","10 points to understand the Takeshima Dispute (PDF)","","","","","","","Takeshima Top","Takeshima Information","Takeshima Dispute","","","Recognition of Takeshima","Sovereignty over Takeshima","Prohibition of Passage to Utsuryo Island","Incorporation of Takeshima into Shimane Prefecture","Takeshima Immediately After World War II","Treatment of Takeshima in the San Francisco Peace Treaty","Takeshima as a Bombing Range for the U.S. Forces","Establishment of “Syngman Rhee Line” and Illegal Occupation of Takeshima by the Republic of Korea","Proposal of Referral to the International Court of Justice","","","Q&A About the Takeshima Dispute","Press Releases","Reference Room","Links","","","","Japan-Republic of Korea Relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(Open a New Window)","","","","","","","","","","","Page Top","Back to Japanese Territory","","","","","About Us","","","Ministers","Officials","Organization","Location","Embassies & Consulates","Diplomatic Archives","About this Site","","","","","News","","","Press Releases","Press Conferences","Speeches","Interviews & Articles","Other Information","","","","","Foreign Policy","","","Diplomatic Bluebook","Japan's Security / Peace & Stability of the International Community","Global Issues & ODA","Economic Diplomacy","Public Diplomacy","Others","","","","","Countries & Regions","","","Asia","Oceania","North America","Latin America and the Caribbean","Europe","Middle East","Africa","","","","","Consular Services","","","Visa","Residing in Japan","Certification","Information about Japan (Links)","The Hague Convention","","","","","","","","","","","Legal Matters","Accessibility","Privacy Policy","About this Site","","","Copyright © Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan","","","","","Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan 2-2-1 Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8919, Japan MAPPhone: +81-(0)3-3580-3311  Japan Corporate Number(JCN): 9000012040001","","","","","","","","","",""]
